    concept:
    To build a web site where you can input patio dimensions to calculate amount of materials required to complete the project
    ie
    patio pavers
    sand / base etc..

    then a basic grid layout to change the design/ colors of the patio by clicking on a particular grid to change the color from a drop down list and thus create a desired design

    Steps: 
    basic html, css, js
        additional bootstrap /jquery

    research the steps and materials required to build a patio
        add my experience and sample / image 



calculate how many patio blocks to fit on the size patio desired
    

    how to calculate how many blocks required based on size
    multiply length by width
        divide 144(# sq inches in a foot) by # of sq inches in the paver
         then
         multply that # by the area sq footage 

TODO
give each option an id to be able to loop thru for correct brick size dependent on what size paver is chosen

make an input for other sizes with a function to calculate
   (maybe add a button and event listener)*added
